# MyShoppingCart
Summer 2019 Developer Intern Challenge

To complete the Summer 2019 Developer Intern Challenge, I implemented a server-side Web API for a shopping cart. This application was built in Java using Spring framework to create a RESTful Web api. Also, I used GraphiQL for the persistence to save and update products.

The application can do numerous calls:
Fetch a product from the database;
Fetch all products;
Fetch all non-empty products;
Purchase a product.
